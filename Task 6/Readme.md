## Task 6 K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) Classification

Steps:

  1.Importing the dataset and normalizing features by StandardScaler method.
  
  2.Using KNeighborsClassifier from sklearn to train the model and predict the outputs.
  
  3.Experimenting with different values of K as choosing the best suitable K value.
  
  4.Evaluating model using accuracy score, confusion matrix and generation classification report and cross validating the outcomes.
  
  5.Visualizing the decision boundaries using heat maps and visualizing the Principal Component Analysis of the given dataset(Dimension Reduction Technique).
