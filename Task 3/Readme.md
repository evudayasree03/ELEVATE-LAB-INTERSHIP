### Task 3: Linear Regression

The main objective of this task is to implement and understand simple and multiple linear regression and univariate and multivariate regression

Tools used are: Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Dataset Used: House Prediction Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harishkumardatalab/housing-price-prediction)
Steps:
  1. Importing and preprocessing the dataset and Performing EDA.
  2. Spliting the data into Training and Testing dataset.
  3. Fit a Linear Regression model using sklearn.linear_model.
  4. Evaluating the model using metrics like Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, R-Squared(R^2) score.
  5. Comparing the Predictions made by the model and Actual data.
